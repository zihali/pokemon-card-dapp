```bash
npm install
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox
```

#### Frontend (React):

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

---

### 3. Compile the Contracts

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

---

### 4. Start the Local Blockchain

In **Terminal 1**:

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

---

### 5. Deploy Contracts to Localhost

In **Terminal 2**:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

Note the two printed addresses ‚Äî they‚Äôre used in `frontend/src/contracts.js`.

---

### 6. Run the Frontend

In **Terminal 3**:

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and connect your MetaMask wallet.

## üîê Security

This platform implements several security best practices:

1. **Reentrancy Protection**:
   - ReentrancyGuard implemented in all value-transferring functions
   - Use of checks-effects-interactions pattern

2. **Access Control**:
   - Role-based access with owner and admin roles
   - Function modifiers to restrict access

3. **Anti-Frontrunning**:
   - Commit-reveal scheme for auction bids
   - Time-locked reveals

4. **Emergency Stop**:
   - Circuit breaker pattern in both contracts
   - Pausable functionality for emergency situations

5. **Secure Fund Management**:
   - Pull pattern for withdrawals
   - Balance updates before transfers
